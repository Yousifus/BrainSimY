## Key Concepts

### Universal Knowledge Store (UKS)
The UKS is BrainSimY's revolutionary knowledge representation system that provides:
- **Structured Knowledge**: Things and Relationships with inheritance
- **Common Sense Reasoning**: Exceptions and conditional logic
- **Temporal Knowledge**: Time-based relationships and expiration
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Confidence scores and uncertainty handling
- **Multi-Modal Integration**: Vision, audio, and sensor data integration

### Hybrid Architecture
BrainSimY combines the best of multiple technologies:
- **C# Performance**: Fast, compiled execution for core knowledge operations
- **Python Flexibility**: Rapid development and extensive AI/ML ecosystem
- **Seamless Bridge**: Python.NET integration for transparent interoperability
- **Modular Design**: Easy extension and customization

### Advanced Features
The system includes sophisticated capabilities:
- **Inheritance with Exceptions**: Mimics human-like reasoning patterns
- **Conditional Logic**: Complex rule-based reasoning with clauses
- **Temporal Reasoning**: Knowledge that changes and expires over time
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatic handling of contradictory information
- **GPT Integration**: AI-assisted knowledge validation and expansion
