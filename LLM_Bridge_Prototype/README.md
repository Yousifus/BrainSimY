## Usage Examples

### Basic Natural Language Query Processing

```python
from LLMInterfaceModule import LLMInterfaceModule, create_test_interface

# Initialize the interface
interface = create_test_interface()

# Process a natural language query
proposal = interface.process_natural_language_query("John is a teacher")

print(f"Query Type: {proposal.query_type.value}")
print(f"UKS Operation: {proposal.uks_operation}")
print(f"Confidence: {proposal.confidence_score:.3f}")
```

### Mediated Reasoning Loop

```csharp
using LLMBridgePrototype;

// Initialize the bridge controller
var controller = new BridgeController();
controller.Initialize();

// Process query through mediated reasoning
var result = await controller.ProcessQueryAsync("Is John a teacher?");

Console.WriteLine($"Fused Confidence: {result.FusedConfidence:F3}");
Console.WriteLine($"Response: {result.UKSResponse}");
```

### Entity Linking and Disambiguation

```python
from EntityLinker import EntityLinker, create_test_entity_linker

# Initialize entity linker
linker = create_test_entity_linker()

# Link entities in text
result = linker.link_entities("John lives in Paris and works at Apple")

# Check linked entities
for entity_text, candidate in result.linked_entities.items():
    print(f"'{entity_text}' -> '{candidate.uks_name}' ({candidate.entity_type.value})")
```

### Confidence Fusion and Hallucination Detection

```csharp
// Initialize confidence fusion
var fusion = new ConfidenceFusion();
fusion.Initialize();

// Fuse LLM and UKS confidences
var result = fusion.FuseConfidences(0.9, 0.2); // High LLM, low UKS

if (result.HallucinationFlag)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Potential hallucination detected: {result.HallucinationReason}");
}
```

## Configuration

### Confidence Thresholds
```csharp
// Default thresholds (can be configured)
private const double DEFAULT_HALLUCINATION_THRESHOLD = 0.3;
private const double DEFAULT_PROMOTION_THRESHOLD = 0.8;
private const double CONFIDENCE_GAP_THRESHOLD = 0.4;
```

### Fusion Weights
```csharp
// Default fusion weights
LLM_Statistical: 0.4
UKS_Logical: 0.4
EntityLinker: 0.1
ContextualFactors: 0.1
```
